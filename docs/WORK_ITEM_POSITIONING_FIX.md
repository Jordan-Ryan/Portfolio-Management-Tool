# üîß Work Item Positioning Fix

## üêõ **Issue Description**

When a work item's start date fell in the middle of a week, it would appear to start at the beginning of the week column instead of on its actual start date. This created visual inconsistency and made it unclear when work items actually started.

## üîç **Root Cause**

The work item positioning logic was using week boundaries only, not accounting for the actual start date within the week. Work items were positioned at the start of their week regardless of their actual start date.

## ‚úÖ **Solution**

Implemented precise positioning that accounts for the actual start date within the week:

### **New Functions Added:**
```typescript
export const getWeekOffset = (date: Date) => {
  // Get the start of the week for the given date
  const { start: weekStart } = getWeekRange(date);
  // Calculate how many days into the week the date is (0-6)
  const daysDiff = Math.floor((date.getTime() - weekStart.getTime()) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  // Return the offset as a fraction of the week (0-1)
  return daysDiff / 7;
};
```

### **Updated Positioning Logic:**
```typescript
// Calculate precise positioning within weeks
const x = (startWeek + startOffset) * weekWidth;

// Calculate precise width
let width;
if (startWeek === endWeek) {
  // Same week - calculate partial width
  width = (endOffset - startOffset) * weekWidth;
} else {
  // Different weeks - calculate full weeks plus partial weeks
  const fullWeeks = endWeek - startWeek - 1;
  const startWeekWidth = (1 - startOffset) * weekWidth;
  const endWeekWidth = endOffset * weekWidth;
  width = startWeekWidth + (fullWeeks * weekWidth) + endWeekWidth;
}
```

## üéØ **How It Works**

1. **`getWeekOffset(date)`** - Calculates how far into the week the date is (0-1 fraction)
2. **Precise X positioning** - `(startWeek + startOffset) * weekWidth` positions items at their actual start date
3. **Precise width calculation** - Accounts for partial weeks at start and end
4. **Drag and drop precision** - Converts pixel position back to exact date within the week

## üìã **Affected Components**

- **TimelineView.tsx** - Work item positioning on the timeline
- **Drag and Drop** - When moving work items to new positions
- **Capacity Calculations** - Week-based capacity calculations
- **Alert System** - Week-based alert calculations

## üß™ **Testing**

The fix ensures that:
- ‚úÖ Work items start on their actual start date within the week
- ‚úÖ Work items only cover the portion of the week they actually span
- ‚úÖ Drag and drop positions work items at precise dates
- ‚úÖ Visual accuracy reflects actual work item durations
- ‚úÖ Proper week-based calculations for capacity and alerts

## üöÄ **Deployment**

- ‚úÖ **Committed** to git with descriptive message
- ‚úÖ **Pushed** to GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ **Deployed** to GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ **Live** at: https://jordan-ryan.github.io/Portfolio-Management-Tool/

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Fixed and Deployed**
**Impact**: Work items now start on their actual dates and only cover the time they actually span
