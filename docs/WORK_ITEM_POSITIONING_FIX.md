# 🔧 Work Item Positioning Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Description**

When a work item's start date fell in the middle of a week, it would appear to start in the middle of the week column instead of at the beginning of the week. This created visual inconsistency and made it unclear when work items actually started.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `getWeekIndex` function in `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` was using `differenceInWeeks(date, baseDate)` which calculated the exact week difference between dates, but didn't account for the fact that work items should always start at the beginning of a week, not in the middle.

## ✅ **Solution**

Modified the `getWeekIndex` function to ensure work items always start at the beginning of their respective weeks:

### **Before:**
```typescript
export const getWeekIndex = (date: Date, baseDate: Date) => {
  return differenceInWeeks(date, baseDate);
};
```

### **After:**
```typescript
export const getWeekIndex = (date: Date, baseDate: Date) => {
  // Get the start of the week for the given date
  const { start: weekStart } = getWeekRange(date);
  // Calculate the difference in weeks from the base date
  return differenceInWeeks(weekStart, baseDate);
};
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **`getWeekRange(date)`** - Gets the start and end of the week containing the given date
2. **`weekStart`** - The beginning of the week (Monday)
3. **`differenceInWeeks(weekStart, baseDate)`** - Calculates the week index based on the start of the week

## 📋 **Affected Components**

- **TimelineView.tsx** - Work item positioning on the timeline
- **Drag and Drop** - When moving work items to new positions
- **Capacity Calculations** - Week-based capacity calculations
- **Alert System** - Week-based alert calculations

## 🧪 **Testing**

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Work items start at the beginning of their week
- ✅ Drag and drop positions work items at week boundaries
- ✅ Visual consistency across the timeline
- ✅ Proper week-based calculations for capacity and alerts

## 🚀 **Deployment**

- ✅ **Committed** to git with descriptive message
